    <h1>Kamado Restoration Project</h1>
    <div class="column">
      <p> Nextdoor.com neighbor gave away his old Kamado grill. I was extrememly excited, but I did want to at least spend a few bucks making it look nice.  Having almost no knowledge of Kamado grills or their history, I decided to spend a great deal of time researching how to restore one.
